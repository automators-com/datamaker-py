# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains auto-generated artifacts from the DataMaker Python SDK.

## Files

- `autocomplete-types.ts` - TypeScript definitions for autocomplete support in the datamaker application

## Generation

These artifacts are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/generate-autocomplete.yml`) on every push to the `main` branch.

To manually generate artifacts:

```bash
python scripts/generate-autocomplete-artifact.py --output-path ./artifacts/autocomplete-types.ts
```

## Usage in Datamaker Repo

The datamaker application can fetch the latest autocomplete types from:

```

```

## Do Not Edit Manually

These files are auto-generated. Any manual edits will be overwritten on the next push to main.
